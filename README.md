# QEC

## Description

This project presents a comprehensive exploration of **Quantum Error Correction (QEC)**, covering both classical and quantum techniques. It includes theoretical foundations such as the **repetition code**, **Hamming code**, and the **Surface Code**â€”a leading topological QEC method.

Practical simulations using **Qiskit** demonstrate the detection and correction of **bit-flip** and **phase-flip** errors in quantum circuits. The project also features the implementation of a **Perfect Weight Matching (PWM)** decoder for the surface code, with benchmarking against varying physical error rates.

Advanced topological concepts such as **homology**, **cohomology**, and the **toric code Hamiltonian** are introduced to explain the behavior of logical qubits and stabilizer structures in a quantum error-correcting lattice.
